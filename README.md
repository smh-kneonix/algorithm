# JavaScript Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of interesting algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Each algorithm has been implemented using modern JavaScript syntax and follows best practices.


## Getting Started
To get started with these algorithms, simply clone the repository and open the file for the algorithm you are interested in. Each file contains a function that implements the algorithm and can be called with an array of data to be sorted or searched.


1. For getting start clone the repository to your local machine
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/smh-kneonix/algorithm
 ```
 
 2. Install nodemon from npm 
 ```bash
 npm install nodemon
```

3. Run the code and it is ready to go
 ```bash
 nodemon filename
 ```
